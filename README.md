Title: Analyse Potential Factors Affecting Forest Coverage of Different Countries

team member: Jiawei Zhao

Hypothesis 1: there would be a negative correlation between the  agriculture land hold by a country and the forest coverage.

Hypothesis 2: there would be a negative correlation between the GDP and the forest coverage of a country.

Hypothesis 3: if a country consumes more meat per capita, the country would have a lower forest coverage. (livestock requires agriculture lands)

Jiaweiz5_Final_project.py: it is the code file contains all the functions and codes, which is also the file used to grade.

Jiaweiz5_Final.ipynb: the jupyter notebook used to test and preview the plot, which is more like a draft.

for presentation.ipynb: this is the jupyter notebook for presentation.

Doctest_ConvertColToDF; Doctest_avgChRateOfCountries.csv; and Doctest_determineRelation.csv: 3 files used for doctests, with the function names in the file name.

all other files are data resources.
